#

I'm in the process of becoming an full stack developer. On the road to create my own digital world in my vision. My current repositories will seem a bit scattered and disjointed but thats part of the learning process, and open view of everything I've done so far. Enjoy the trip!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Completing Fullstack Academy
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, React, SQL, postQL, Express.js and many other things
- ⚗️ I'm completing many small projects to grow my skills and learn new things
